          Maintaining a garden is a joy for some, but a burden for others. Daily
          pressures on our time and energy can leave little capacity to ensure
          our gardens are in top shape at all times.

          {`True garden maintenance is the regular care devoted to keeping a
          garden looking great. This means different things for different people
          and different gardens. Some gardens will require a fortnightly lawn
          cut and monthly hedge trim. Other gardens will demand much more
          involved attention. Here's how we can help you.`}
