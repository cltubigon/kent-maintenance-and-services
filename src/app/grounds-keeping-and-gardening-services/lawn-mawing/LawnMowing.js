      </h3>

        We carefully and professionally mow lawns of all shapes and sizes in
        gardens and other grounds in and around Kent. We provide free quotes
        with no obligation for grass cutting, and can provide this service as a
        one-off or part of ongoing garden maintenance.
      </p>
      <p className={''}>
        Getting the cutting height and mowing frequency right can make a huge
        difference to the ongoing health of the lawn.
