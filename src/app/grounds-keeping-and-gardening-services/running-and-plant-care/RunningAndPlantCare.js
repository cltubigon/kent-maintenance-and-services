        WHAT IS PRUNING?
      </h3>
      <p className={''}>
        When a tree or plant has outgrown the space it was intended to occupy in
        a garden, it is only natural to want to reduce it in size. Trees
        typically need to be pruned and reduced in size if they have dead,
        diseased, crossing or torn branches.
