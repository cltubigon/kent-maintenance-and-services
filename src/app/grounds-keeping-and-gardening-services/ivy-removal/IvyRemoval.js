        it can very quickly become a major pest.It can choke native plants,
        destroy the health of trees, damage windows, roofs and gutters.

        Ivy is a powerful irritant and is poisonous to some living beings and is
        best removed professionally. There is no doubt that an old stone
        Lakeland cottage furnished in swathes of green ivy can look delightful
        and idyllic, but in reality, ivy is an intrusive weed that grows and
        spreads rapidly, smothering and potentially damaging any surface it
        clings to for purchase.
      </p>
      <p className={''}>
        With professional techniques and patience, ivy can be removed
        effectively without the application of weed killers that could
        potentially damage other foliage and surfaces surrounding and beneath
        its scope.
