        A beautiful and functional deck or pergola provides you with an outdoor
        entertainment area while adding value to your home. As these structures
        are subject to the elements year-round, it is important to maintain your
        deck and pergola to ensure it continues to look good, is safe to use,
        and lasts for years to come.
