        It is important to ensure your gutters are clean all year round. We
        recommend regular maintenance of all gutters to prevent a build up of
        leaves, sticks, and dirt. By doing this you are able to minimise the
        risk of gutters flooding and being damaged, the the ingress of water to
        the roof and wall cavities. If your home is near the bush, regular
        maintenance of your gutters can also help protect your home from the
        threat of bushfires.
